I would monitor multiple ubuntu machines using prometheus, telegraf and grafana

telegraf would have to be installed on all the machines, it will collect metrics from the operating system, running software and any other inputs. The data is then collected by 
prometheus and stored in some sort of persistant storage. 

I would then have a grafana instance running centrally which will pull data from each of the persistant storage nodes for visulization. It could also handle alerting with the
prometheus alertmanager plugin.
